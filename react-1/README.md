# Task #1

Place 3 Buttons on screen with these labels:

"Red" "Green" "Blue"

Below the buttons there should be a text saying:  

Learning React is fun!  

Text is initially black

When the user clicks on the Red button, the text should change its color to red  
When the user clicks on the Green button, the text should change its color to green  
When the user clicks on the Blue button, the text should change its color to blue  

Use CSS classes for this, no inline styles!
